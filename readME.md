# Description

Tired of bootstrap templates that are so overused it makes the entire world wide web look the same?
Passionate about front end development?
Ever dreamt of designing web elements like carousels, navbars, jumbotrons, and grids based on your design aesthetic?
Have you already built your own web elements in your previous LG projects?
Then this is the project for you!

You will build your own web elements for the front end and publish that code so it can be later used by anyone to build their own site. Here is an example of a Bootstrap type site that was built by 4 college kids!

This project has two stages:

Reverse engineer a set of components from the Bootstrap framework.
Modify your components with your own styles, fonts, and colors to make a unique set of design elements.
Context

The first stage of the project will help you solidify your understanding of design elements on the web and how they work. You will get to know CSS and HTML inside and out.

In the second stage, you will get a better understanding of design and user experience. Tap into your creative side on the front end.

As you work through the project, make use of your browser’s developer tools to fine-tune your design. Remember to keep your feedback loops small, fast, and specific! When you make changes to the HTML & CSS, don’t just blindly guess-and-check: make hypotheses, test them, and then learn from your mistakes!

Read and reference good resources on the web to build your conceptual understanding of HTML, CSS, and how the browser uses them to build a styled web page. Start with the resources section below.

Stage 1: Reverse Engineer Bootstrap Components

Typography

 -[] Styles replicate Bootstrap’s Headings  
 -[] Styles replicate Bootstrap’s Body copy  
 -[] Styles replicate Bootstrap’s Addresses  
 -[] Styles replicate Bootstrap’s Blockquotes  
Components

 -[] Each component is featured on the demo HTML page demo.html under its own header along with the code used to generate it (for a simple example of what this could look like, see https://purecss.io/buttons/)  
 -[] Styles replicate Bootstrap’s buttons  
Components include replicas of Bootstrap’s:

-[] Button Groups: Toolbar  
-[] Breadcrumbs  
-[] Pagination  
-[] Labels  
-[] Badges  
-[] Jumbotron  
-[] Page Header  
-[] Thumbnails  
-[] Alerts  
-[] List Group  
-[] Panels  
-[] Wells  

Stage 2: Modify the Styles

Now it’s time to make it look good. Make changes to the CSS (not the HTML) to apply your own styles to the design.

Demo page demo.html shows components/elements with customized styles, including (but not limited to):

-[] A different typeface (take a look at Google Fonts for inspiration)  
-[] A unique and different color palette (take a look at Adobe Color CC for inspiration)  

Style should be cohesive, connecting the elements as a whole. For example, a similar color palette is chosen.
